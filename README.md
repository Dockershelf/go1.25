# gogo1.25

Debian packaging for Go 1.25: repackages the official precompiled toolchain from [go.dev](https://go.dev/dl/) into `golang-1.25-go` packages for enterprise `.deb`-only installs.

## Supported Debian suites

- `trixie`
- `unstable`

Packaging trees live under `debiandirs/<suite>/`. Changelog tracks:

- **mainline** — `changelogs/mainline/<suite>`
- **nightly** — `changelogs/nightly/<suite>`

## Build (from workspace)

Clone or seed this repo as a sibling of `go-pipeline/`, then from `go-pipeline/`:

```bash
make materialize GO=1.25 DIST=trixie
make build GO=1.25
```
